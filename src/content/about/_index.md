My name is Oscar and I enjoy hacking, building, and discovering how things work! 

I studied Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz and I was fortunate to have had various internships, jobs, and experiences that lead me to find what I was passionate about. I am presently dabbling around with various technologies, namely, AWS, Node, and APIs of applications I enjoy using. Aside from programming, I enjoy reading about the tech industry, playing soccer, and a good cup of coffee. 

If you'd like to chat, feel free to drop me a line @ my <a href="mailto:oscar@bepurposeful.co">email</a>
