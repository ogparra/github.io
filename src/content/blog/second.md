<h2> Creating the habit of writing code everyday </h2>

One thing that I found difficult as a student was knowing what to write and being passionate about it. Often times, I would write sufficient code to pass a class assignment and not know what to work on next. Also, I found that coming home in the evenings, I sometimes lacked the motivation to continue writing code unless the solution was clear.

A few years ago I had the pleasure of reading John Resig's article, <a href="https://johnresig.com/blog/write-code-every-day/"> Write Code Every Day </a>, where he disusses his short comings on not being able to write code everyday and feeling that he wasnt making enough progress. I found his article helped me consider habits that would allow me to write better code, feel less anxious, and get more work done. 

Nowadays, it's been easier to be more consistent about writing code everyday without worrying about school or work. Moreover, it's also helped reminding myself of why I began writing code in the first place and reflecting on my current goals. 

I am very passionate about building community, productivity, and empowering others and I believe that writing code everyday will allow me to accomplish that!

I'm really looking forward to continuing to write code everday and being able to measure my growth.
