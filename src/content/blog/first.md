<h2>Building with Hugo</h2>


<a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> is a popular open-source static site generator that I used to build this website with! 

Prior to using Hugo, I designed my own website using custom HTML, CSS, and jQuery in my freshman year of college, At the time, I found that making my own website was fun and surely I learned various thing about web when building my personal website, however, jump forward 4 years later and I was looking redesign with a few things in mind: 
<ul>
	<li> Performance </li>
	<li> Simple to edit </li>
	<li> Flexibility </li>
</ul>

A friend had mentioned that they used the framework, Hugo, and I decided to check it out. To my surprise, it was really fast to install, configure, and deploy the website!

Another thing that I enjoyed while getting setup, was how simple it was to edit. Moving forward, this will allow me to share my thoughts on the industry, updates on what I'm learning, and events that I attend. 

I'm really looking forward to learning more about Hugo and getting into the details of how the framework works, but for now, I'm happy to have found it and used it to redesign my website!
